Description: The package provides a comprehensive data analysis pipeline tailored for
    processing TCGA RNA-seq data alongside associated clinical metadata. It
    offers functionalities for loading the RNA-seq data and clinical metadata
    from CSV files, performing normalization and z-score transformation on
    the RNA-seq data, conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
    dimensionality reduction, optional data cleaning to handle missing
    values and merge datasets, visualization of PCA results with customizable
    options for coloring and labeling based on clinical metadata, K-means
    clustering with automated determination of the optimal number of clusters
    using silhouette analysis, and visualization of K-means clustering
    results on a scatter plot. This pipeline streamlines the process of
    exploratory data analysis and clustering of TCGA RNA-seq data,
    facilitating insights into underlying biological patterns and
    associations with clinical variables.
